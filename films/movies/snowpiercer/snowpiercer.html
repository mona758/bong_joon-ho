            Snowpiercer (2013) is a dystopian science fiction thriller set in a future where Earth has become an uninhabitable frozen wasteland after a failed climate experiment. The only survivors live on a perpetually moving train, the Snowpiercer, which endlessly circles the globe. Inside, society is strictly divided by class, with the wealthy and privileged occupying the front cars while the oppressed and impoverished are confined to the back. Led by Curtis Everett, the tail-end passengers launch a desperate rebellion to reach the engine and confront the train’s creator, Mr. Wilford. The journey uncovers secrets about the train, the world outside, and the true cost of survival.

    <!--Trivia & Fun Facts -->
    <h2 id="facts">Trivia & Fun Fact</h2>
    <div class="facts">
        <h4>Inspired by a Graphic Novel</h4>
        <p>
            Snowpiercer is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob and Jean-Marc Rochette. Bong Joon-ho was captivated by it and envisioned a film adaptation.
        </p>
        <h4>Bong’s Unique Cast Choice</h4>
        <p>
            Bong Joon-ho specifically wanted Song Kang-ho for the role of Namgoong Minsoo and adjusted the script to fit him, showcasing the collaboration’s significance.
        </p>
        <h4>Filmed in a Real Train Set</h4>
        <p>
            To capture the confined space of the train, a massive train set was built with actual compartments, enhancing the claustrophobic, gritty atmosphere.
        </p>
        <h4>Hidden Messages in Design</h4>
        <p>
            Minister Mason, portrayed by Tilda Swinton, wore odd and outdated fashion as Bong wanted her to look like a figure of absurd authority, embodying the satire of bureaucratic corruption.
        </p>
        <h4>A 30-Year Journey</h4>
        <p>
            The Snowpiercer train is designed to circle the globe annually, with each lap taking exactly one year, symbolizing the unchanging cycle of class oppression.
        </p>
        <h4>Symbolic Fish Scene</h4>
        <p>
            The scene where guards use fish blood for a ritual before fighting was Bong’s idea to show the brutality and ritualistic loyalty within the train's elite.
        </p>
        <h4>International Success</h4>
        <p>
            Snowpiercer became the highest-grossing Korean film in international markets at the time, breaking new ground for Korean cinema abroad.
        </p>
        <h4>Climate Change Commentary</h4>
        <p>
            The movie subtly critiques environmental and political issues, highlighting humanity’s short-sighted actions leading to environmental collapse and extreme social hierarchies.
