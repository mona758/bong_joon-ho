            Mother is a gripping, psychological thriller about a devoted single mother who takes matters into her own hands when her son, Do-joon, is accused of a brutal murder he may not have committed. Despite his intellectual disability, Do-joon is framed for the crime, and the film follows his mother's relentless search for the truth. As she unravels the mystery, she faces difficult moral choices, and the boundaries between justice and vengeance blur.
            Directed by Bong Joon-ho, Mother explores themes of sacrifice, maternal love, and the lengths to which a mother will go to protect her child. The film delivers a powerful emotional punch and builds an intricate, suspenseful narrative, while delving into the complexities of familial bonds and societal expectations. The mother’s fight to prove her son’s innocence reveals disturbing secrets about their small community and forces viewers to question the nature of justice.
